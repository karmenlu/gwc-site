          <p>We are Girls Who Code of Grove Hall. Girls Who Code is a non-profit organization working to
            close the gender gap in technology. Typically, we hold in-person workshops every other Saturday
            throughout an academic semester to teach middle schoolers and high schoolers the basics of computer
            programming. Together, we have done step-by-step lectures on inclusive design, generated random shapes with Python,
            mixed music with EarSketch, covered the basics of Java, and much more. We're a lot of fun. :)
